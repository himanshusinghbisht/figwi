we all logon to our terminals every once a while
wouldn't it be interesting to have some initials or nickname displayed on opening screen of terminal 

This can be done by editing .bashrc file in linux

use 
wick@wicked:~$ gedit .bashrc

and add the formatted output of figwi to it in topmost part or anywhere in file by using echo ""

It would take a lot of time to create a formatted text manually
hence this tool can be of great help to make formatted text for any purpose 


There is one minute problem as i have stated in all the files that this will work only for lowercase letters
but if you want to edit this you can by making minor changes and this will work for uppercase and numbers too

if you don't want to do all the hardwork you can just install figlet 
by -


root@wicked:/home/wick# apt-get install figlet

Have fun !
