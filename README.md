# figwi
figwi is a tool that can be used to create fancy text from plain text, it is similar to figlet .. i have written code for only lowecase letters and exclude uppercase letters and numbers from it, It is just to show how figlet can be implemented using c++ . it can be written for uppercase letters by minor editing. This code will run in linux systems for running it in windows systems you will have to redefine gotoxy() function , it is simple to do..
